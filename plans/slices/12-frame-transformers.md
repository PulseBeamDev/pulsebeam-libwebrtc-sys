# S12: Transform live encoded frames safely

Status: **not started**. Future assignment required; this is not a resumed execution order.
Baseline: commit `52b4d80`; pinned SDK `ba469aa2093ba950066258ca0a59a6fbd1295582`.
Read [shared-contract](../shared-contract.md) and [checkpoint](../checkpoint.md) first.

## User-visible outcome

Install caller transformer/completions on actual sender and receiver paths and deliver/return retained native frames.

## Dependencies and parallel boundary

- Completion prerequisites: none beyond the frozen checkpoint and shared contract.
- This lane can start independently from the checkpoint; it does not wait for a global ledger, all documentation or another domain's implementation.
- Consumers of this slice: only applicable composed acceptance, not a blanket dependency for all lanes.
- Legacy task references: #9, #10. Reference only; read source instead of replaying old todos.

## Scope

- Preserve already-qualified stock frame ownership/cloning and callback-slot composition; do not recreate drivers.
- Prove actual packetizer/setter/metadata/time/geometry consumption and SDK role/producer provenance before admission.
- Install live callbacks with retirement and late-completion handling; compose instead of displacing required stock callbacks.

## Existing work to preserve

Use the current implementations, fixtures and contracts below. Distinguish **source
exists**, **named checkpoint evidence**, and **remaining actual application path**.
Do not recreate owned value graphs or temporary drivers merely to restart.

## Write ownership

Reserved lane files/regions, after confirming no competing lease:

- `src/frame_transformer.rs`
- `native/frame_transformer.h`
- `native/frame_transformer.cc`
- `native/frame_callback_slot.h`
- `tests/slice_12_transformers.rs`

Shared bridge/codec/peer/actor/native/header/build seams are owned by the
integration coordinator as listed in the shared contract. Use one branch/worktree;
propose narrow, named seam patches and serialize their merge. If an existing file
above is split with another slice, the listed section lease is mandatory. New tests
must be slice-owned instead of concurrent edits to shared audio/video fixtures.

## End-to-end work checklist

- [ ] Reconcile the pinned public members, checkpoint source and applicable evidence into a local coverage table.
- [ ] Deliver the missing typed API/values and real native implementation for the outcome above.
- [ ] Install through the actual public builders/endpoints and ProductionSession where applicable; standalone-only APIs must be explicit.
- [ ] Preserve defaults/optional/native errors, buffer bounds, roles, callback reentry/concurrency and dependent-resource/final-drop retention.
- [ ] Integrate coordinator-owned seams and document the usable contract/examples within this slice.
- [ ] Compile and execute the real public workflow and failures on a matching candidate artifact through verify.
- [ ] Run applicable actor migration, controlled-mode and sanitizer/lifecycle cases; record exact scope or concrete blockers.
- [ ] Review and commit the coherent slice. An uninstalled provider, fake success or unrun fixture is not done.

## Specific acceptance

- A real call passes caller-transformed data through native delivery, not just standalone clone tests.
- Late completion/unregister/alias/drop/migration and supported mutations are safe; unsupported constructors remain truthful.

Start with existing related `tests/` fixtures, then execute the dedicated slice
fixture. Use the shared contract's verification rules. Name exact commands and
prerequisites when launching gates; do not assume checkpoint artifact freshness
after native/bridge/build changes. Hardware, controlled, core/native and unavailable
cases must be explicitly distinguished rather than silently skipped as success.

## Exclusions and stop conditions

The existing companion proves ownership, not live delivery. No fabricated passkey frame or arbitrary metadata repair.

All shared exclusions apply. If a real native consumer makes the required outcome
unsafe or unsupported, record the exact branch/contract conflict and escalate it.
Do not broaden invalid-domain analysis, patch the SDK, normalize output, substitute
a stock provider or quietly reduce scope to make the test pass.
